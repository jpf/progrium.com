            <h1><a href="/blog/2009/12/08/hacker-dojo-place-of-the-way-of-the-hacker/">Hacker Dojo: place of the way of the hacker</a></h1>
            <p>Two weeks ago it was being taped for a story on Fox News. One month ago it received a congratulatory visit from the mayor of Mountain View. Two months ago it was featured on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/progrium/4017351989/">the front page</a> of the Mercury News. And four months ago was when we signed the lease for it. Hacker Dojo is officially on its way to something big.</p>

<p><a href="http://hackerdojo.com">Hacker Dojo</a>, aspiring to be a global hub of innovation, is based on a simple idea: to provide a community center for hackers, thinkers and technologists to meet, discuss, learn and create.</p>

<p>It's a non-profit, volunteer-run, member-supported operation that simply provides a space for hackers to do their thing 24/7, whether it's working on side projects, organizing a meetup, building the next startup, giving a class, working remotely, or just hanging out with diverse yet like-minded people. The thing they have in common is the hacker spirit, a force that drives ordinary but curious people to create what can end up being extraordinary, such as the personal computer, the first video game system, or the technology powering the Internet.</p>

<p>A dojo is considered a place to do and train one's craft with others. It's most commonly used in the context of martial arts or other physical training. But the word "dojo" is simply defined as "place of the way." In the case of Hacker Dojo, that way is the way of the hacker.</p>

<p>The hacker is not what most people think. Although 99% of the 100+ members of Hacker Dojo are capable of doing the things most people think "hackers" do, I'm 100% positive none of us have the intention of doing those things maliciously if at all. In fact, security has almost nothing to do with the way of the hacker. We define a hacker something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A hacker is expert in their field, whether hobby or professional, that pushes the envelope of what's possible through hands-on exploration, driven by relentless curiosity and a desire to challenge the status quo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Steven Levy, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Computer-Revolution-Steven-Levy/dp/0141000511">Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</a>, describes computer hackers as people that "regard computing as the most important thing in the world." It's about passion. It's about something most of us can't even describe. It inexplicably compels us to explore technology. To build things. To learn things. To be like the heroes in our field and achieve the remarkable, which is something I think everybody can relate to.</p>

<p>In fact, there is no reason why anybody shouldn't aspire to be like a hacker, an innovator. This is what Hacker Dojo is about. We want to foster hacker culture so it can grow, develop and spread. We want to make its values explicit, and be the "place of the way" of the hacker.</p>

<p>If you still don't understand the hacker, or want to learn more, take a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">Hacker ethic article</a> on Wikipedia. There's also an excellent, short documentary available to watch online that shows you the energy and excitement of true hackers called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=906FF3F2339D0C70">Hackers: Wizards of the Electronic Age</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to get involved in Hacker Dojo, come stop by or <a href="http://hackerdojo.com/">visit the website</a>! We hold many events at the Dojo, but it's also generally open for anybody to come and hack. If you're too far to come to us, you may find another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace">hackerspace</a> nearby. For example, in SF there is the excellent <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge">Noisebridge</a> hackerspace.</p>

<p>When you're this obsessed with technology, so much that most "normal" people have no idea what you're talking about, it helps to have a place where people don't think you're crazy. People have moved to Mountain View to be closer to Hacker Dojo. If you already live nearby, you should definitely take advantage of this place of the way of the hacker.</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2009/11/05/why-efficiency-is-not-as-important-as-you-think/">Why efficiency is not as important as you think</a></h1>
            <blockquote>
  <p>"Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things." -Peter Drucker</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When people, usually analytical people, want to improve a situation, they tend to optimize efficiency: achieve maximum output for input. "Let's reduce waste! Let's simplify! Let's make things smoother! Let's try and get more out of the system!" I suppose the obsession with efficiency is explained in the Drucker quote: that efficiency is "doing things right." Who wouldn't want to do things right?</p>

<p>The problem with efficiency is that it has nothing to do with whether or not what you are currently doing is the right thing to do. Whereas effectiveness is about achieving the right result, or being on the right path.</p>

<p>Too many people assume a system is on the right path. If there is a problem, they address it by smoothing things out and making the process more efficient without questioning the larger system they were produced in. But if the system is going in the wrong direction, that's only going to make the real problem worse. The push for more standardized testing in public education comes to mind.</p>

<p>What's really important is effectiveness. In the end, it doesn't matter if your business is spending the least amount possible or your computer program running as fast as possible or your lifestyle entirely streamlined. If it's effective, it achieves the desired goal. Your business is producing value, your program is functionally useful, your lifestyle is making you happy. Effectiveness is qualitative. Efficiency is quantitative, which is why I think it's so big with analytical people. Probably intelligent people in general.</p>

<p>If you think about it, intelligence, especially knowledge, is mostly concerned with efficiency. It's more about how to solve problems, less so with what problems to solve. Knowledge is a tool. It's neutral. To what ends do you actually use it for? That requires values and intentionâ€”the realm of wisdom. A wise person tends to be an effective person.</p>

<p>When approaching a problem, wisdom and pragmatism must frame intelligence. Before you start thinking about efficiency, you should step back and think about effectiveness. In computer engineering this idea spread with Donald Knuth's quote "premature optimization is the root of all evil." His argument being that 97% of efficiency optimizations are unnecessary to achieve functionality, at which point you can determine which optimizations will be the most effective improvements of efficiency.</p>

<p>In a way, it's a look before you leap argument. Don't get me wrong with all this. Efficiency is terribly valuable and can improve a situation, but only if you're on the right path. Just because a system is currently working or was previously working doesn't mean it should be, or will in the future. You should always consider effectiveness before efficiency, even in "working" systems. Here's why:</p>

<p>Effectiveness opens the door for efficiency, but efficiency can change the requirements for effectiveness.</p>

<p>Quantitative improvements can qualitatively change the situation if taken far enough. The game can change. For example, you can become so efficient at producing cars that production isn't the problem anymore. Then it's a question of variety, like choice of color. "You can have any color as long as that color is black," Ford said, and soon after lost the lead in car manufacturing. Perhaps when business slowed, they tried to make their sales and marketing or administrative organization more efficient. They didn't re-asses whether the thing they were doing so right (building cars so efficiently)â€¦ was the right thing. The effective thing.</p>

<p>Efficiency is important, but powerless without effectiveness. Always keep an eye on effectiveness.</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2009/10/29/public-open-source-services/">Public Open Source Services</a></h1>
            <p>Last night I went off and put up a wiki about an idea I've been thinking about for a while: <a href="http://poss.gliderlab.com/">public open source services</a> or POSS. Think: public services or utilities on the web run as open source.</p>

<p>Unlike open source software, web services aren't just source code. They're source code that <em>runs</em>. They have to be maintained in order to keep running, and the resources they consume have to be paid for. This is why most web services are built using a business as the vehicle. This effectively constrains what you can build by framing it as something that needs to turn a profit or support you to work on it. But does it need to be that way? Can web services be built in a way that make it self-sufficient? Not needing some ambivalent leader to take responsibility for it?</p>

<p>I originally blogged about it in February 2007, 6 months after I first wrote about webhooks. Unfortunately my old blog isn't online right now. Back then, I was trying to solve the administrative problem. How do you maintain the servers in an open source way? My idea then, was to build a self-managing system using something like cfengine or Puppet, where the recipes and configurations are kept with the publicly available source code. As new configurations are checked in, the server(s) adopt the new directives and continue to self-manage.</p>

<p>The practicality of such a setup is a little far fetched, but seemed pretty feasible for smaller projects. However, since the release of Google App Engine, this concern for simple web applications has disappeared. Google just automates the system administration, and scaling! This means to run the app, you just have to write the code and hit deploy. That's a huge step! Administration concerns? Pretty much solved.</p>

<p>The next thing is the financial concern. How do you pay for it? Or rather, how does it pay for itself? This took longer to figure out, but here we are. From the wiki essay:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You use the same Google Merchant account that App Engine debits as the one that accepts donations. This way no bank account is involved. Then you track the money that goes into the account (using the Google Merchant IPN equivalent). Then you look at your usage stats from the App Engine panel and predicate future usage trends. Then calculate the cost per month. Then divide the cash in the account by that and you have how long the service will run. You make this visible on all pages (at the bottom, say) that this service will run for X months, "Pay now to keep it running." You accept any amount, but you are completely clear about what the costs are. And this is all automated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take the humans out of the loop!</p>

<p>Then you rely on the same sort of community approach of open source to contribute to the application. Like a few members of the project community are given certain rights, some will be given permission to deploy the app from time to time for updating the running service.</p>

<p>If the service isn't useful, nobody uses it, it's not paid for, it disappears. If it is useful, people will pay for it to keep it running. They are assured they are paying operating costs, which are significantly lower than most because it doesn't include paying for human resources! Volunteers might need to meddle with settings, but otherwise, the coders are in control and the community accepts or denies changes made by whoever wants them.</p>

<p>So if this is interesting, read the <a href="http://poss.gliderlab.com/">full essay I wrote up on the wiki</a>. It's been my intention to prototype and validate this model with many of my projects.</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2009/06/26/why-minimalist-software-wins-at-workflow/">Why minimalist software wins at workflow</a></h1>
            <p>Recently I've been evaluating software to help support agile/scrum development on our team, and ideally to roll into our NASA Code product for others to use. We're already married to <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>, so we've been playing with <a href="http://www.agile42.com/cms/pages/agilo/">Agilo</a> and are looking at some of the other agile plugins for Trac. Unfortunately they're all so heavyweight, despite some that claim not to be.</p>

<p>I came back to a realization I'm sure a lot of us have had: most software sucks. Especially software that's intended to augment some real-life process. When asking friend/colleague <a href="http://timothyfitz.com">Timothy Fitz</a> about recommendations on agile tools, he said: "A board and post-its. Seriously."</p>

<p>This is part of the reason most enterprise software sucks so terribly. Enterprise is about lots of real-life process and workflow, and given that process augmentation software even in small doses generally sucks, large amounts of it will suck exponentially.</p>

<p>A lot of us have learned that less software is more effective. One major attraction of Trac was their goal of staying out of the way through minimalism. The trick with minimalism, in general, is knowing what's actually important; the essence of the message or design. This is a big part of my design process. Asking, "How can I fold these requirements into fewer features and UI?" instead of directly implementing a feature for every requirement.</p>

<p>The other thing about minimalism is that, like abstraction (another form of compression), everything you leave in the design makes such a huge difference. In programming, when you make abstractions, you're deciding what you can assume. This means abstractions can go in different directions depending on the assumption requirements of what's going to use the abstraction. The risk with minimalist software is that a simple design choice can drastically change the direction of the abstraction and make or break whether the software fits your needs.</p>

<p>Luckily, minimalism buys you a sort of abstraction that can enable projection. By this I mean that users can project their actual process and workflow onto the software. If it doesn't have features that impose a particular process, users are free to do what works for them. This is why wikis are so powerful.</p>

<p>Coming back to Timothy's "a board and post-its" remark, why do you even need software? If you can do it without software, why would you want to bring software in to slow things down?</p>

<p>Software does have a couple strengths. First, it encodes process in way that means you can automate parts of it. Nobody has to worry about manually typesetting when using a word processor. Second, it persists and organizes information that would normally be lost in handwritten notes, or worse, somebody's head. The trick is getting these advantages without getting in the way.</p>

<p>A naive approach to software design is thinking that perfectly modeling a system, such as your development process, is the way to good software. I used to think this. It sounds great because then you can programmatically reason about every aspect of the system. But in the real-world, no two systems are exactly alike. In fact, a given system can change quite a bit in its lifetime. So there's really no point to modeling systems with that kind of precision.</p>

<p>However, I'm seeing a lot of this in agile/scrum software. Requirements have stories, stories have tasks, organized into iterations and releases. CRUD for every noun mentioned in scrum. This on top of abstractions in a direction different than we need. Numbers where it doesn't really matter. Nice pie chart breakdowns we'll rarely use. Top it off with horrible UI, since with all these features there isn't time to make them easy to use.</p>

<p>Honestly, <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/">Pivotal Tracker</a> seems to have the best abstraction of agile. It folds requirements, stories and tasks into just stories. It automatically and dynamically creates iterations and calculates velocity. It keeps you on a single page, keeping you focused on what's important.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we can't use Pivotal Tracker since we'd need it on our servers and the licensing they offered doesn't scale if we want to essentially give it away as part of NASA Code. It's likely I'll want to just start nudging Trac in the right direction using Pivotal Tracker as a model reference, pulling together code from Agilo and other plugins. If there's one thing that complements minimalist design, it's an extension architecture, and Trac has an excellent plugin system.</p>

<p>Anyway, as far as augmenting process and workflow, I've always liked the idea of starting with a wiki and lazily formalizing the process into custom software as needed. As long as you can keep it under control, mind your requirement abstractions, and avoid writing too much software.</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2009/06/17/oh-no-hackers/">Oh no! Hackers!</a></h1>
            <p>That's right. Hide your floppies and cover your Ethernet ports. Virus-laden hackers are coming to take over your computer, steal your passwords, and do terrible things! Like hack your MySpace! Oh noes!</p>

<p>I guess I'm getting over the fact that we probably won't be able to undo the damage done with the public's perception of what a "hacker" is. Perhaps, though, we can overload it to the point of ambiguity, so there's at least some question of context whether it's the good kind or the bad kind.</p>

<p>The problem is that positive connotations aren't enough. The people that would venture to understand "hackers" the slightest bit more than what they hear in the headlines are going to pretty quickly find the "good hackers" â€¦ they're white hats, right?</p>

<p>The other day I was questioned by somebody (that should know better) if I hacked somebody's website that was recently compromised. Seriously? My response was "I barely have enough time to do important things, let alone something that would be a waste of my time."</p>

<p>I self-identify as a hacker. I invite my friends over to "hack." I started a party for "hackers and thinkers" (a very intentional choice of words). I'm co-founding a community center called Hacker Dojo. What are we doing at all these functions? Building and learning.</p>

<p>We use the term perhaps too liberally, but always implying tribute to the true hackers that, as Steven Levy put it, "regard computing as the most important thing in the world."</p>

<p>These people push the envelope of what's possible through hands-on exploration, driven by relentless curiosity and a desire to challenge the status quo. Steve Wozniak, Lee Felsenstein, Linus Torvalds, Tim Berners-Lee, John Carmackâ€¦</p>

<p>Hell, there's something big behind this idea, why stop at computing? Buckminster Fuller, Nikola Tesla, Richard Feynman, Alfred Kinsey, Ben Franklinâ€¦</p>

<p>Perhaps we're generalizing too far. Perhaps we're rendering "hacker" meaningless. Or are we giving it more meaning? Getting down to its essence. I wouldn't be defending this idea so strongly if I didn't think it had some great significance to humanity.</p>

<p>What upsets me is that many who would identify as hackers in this sense seem to be afraid to claim it. Most likely in fear of confusing the layman that has the media's myopic view of hackers. You've never heard of the canonical conference for real hackers. No, it's not DefCon. (Just get up and leave.) It's a conference called Hackers. You've never heard of it because they keep it secret!</p>

<p>This conference was started to gather everybody together that was mentioned in Steven Levy's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Computer-Revolution-Steven-Levy/dp/0141000511/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1245307316&amp;sr=8-2">Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</a> (one of the last good publication on hackers, and it came out in 1984!). This conference holds all the values of true hackerism and it's been happening for 25 years. But they won't promote it! It goes by a fake name and even has all mentions of "hacker" on their website replaced with an image so it won't be indexed. Seriously??</p>

<p>Trying to supplant public perception of hackers by just saying they're something different and providing a better name nobody uses ("crackers") is not going to work. It hasn't worked. They need something to replace those visions of crackers with. We need tangible examples and stories. We need heroes. Heroes willing to wear the title.</p>

<p>Luckily, we have a new generation of hackers. One that has started a global movement called <a href="http://hackerspaces.org/">hackerspaces</a>, probably one of the biggest things for hackers in years. Our local hackerscene fostered by Silicon Valley culture and events like <a href="http://devhouse.org">SuperHappyDevHouse</a> have led to a hackerspace we hope will have a big impact. One that proudly wears the name hacker: <a href="http://hackerdojo.com">Hacker Dojo</a>.</p>
